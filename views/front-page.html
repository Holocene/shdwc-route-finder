                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>
                    This is a tool for keeping track of wormholes, and also route finding through them.
                    It is tested in Firefox and Chrome.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Check out the 'route finder' tab, which is the most interesting thing in the
                    system right now.
                </p>

                <p>

                <h2>How do I use this tool?</h2>

                <h3>Video Guide</h3>

                <p>Check out this 12 minute guide to probing wormholes and using the tool:
                    <a style="font-size:150%;" href="https://youtu.be/eq8OnXZKwp8">https://youtu.be/eq8OnXZKwp8</a>
                </p>

                <h3>Scanning</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to the <a href="/#/system-list">systems page</a></li>
                    <li>Find the system you are in.</li>
                    <li>In EVE, scan some signatures with your probe scanner. Select them all, then copy 
                    them to clipboard (hint: ctrl-A, ctrl-C).</li>
                    <li>Click 'paste scan results' to copy your results into the tool</li>
                    <li>Add any wormholes you find.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you add the signatures you find to the tool, it's easier for the next prober 
                to work out what sigs are new and what have stayed the same.</p>

                <h3>Route finding</h3>
                <p>Go to the <a href="#/route-finder">route finding page.</a> Enter your start
                and destination system and you'll see an array of routes. Use the filters on the
                right to set system restrictions (no highsec) or transport method restrictions (no titans,
                or no wormholes).</p>
